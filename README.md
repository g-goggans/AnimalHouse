Here are some helpful Git commands when working with our GitHub page:

  # this will not add the file immediately; you must commit and push after adding
  git add [the file you would like to add to the repo]
  
  # commit the changes; this does not update the public repo
  git commit [the file you are working on] -m “[the message to describe your update]” 
  
  # push all of your changes to update in the repo
  git push origin	
  
  # update the repo to your computer
  git fetch --all
